# Welcome to the AlbertaSat Github ðŸ‘‹

AlbertaSat is a team of around 80 undergraduate students. Our main goal is to support the training and development of highly qualified personnel in the space industry, by providing students with the opportunity to design, build and operate aerospace technology. The team is supported by alumni, faculty advisors and industry advisors. We are a diverse team with students from a variety of disciplines such as Engineering, Science, Business, Education and more. 

Software team members are responsible for all things software in AlbertaSat, particulary the OBC, and the ground station software.
